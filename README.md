**Discord bot for roleplay game**

This is a discord bot programmed in Python for a client.
It works in the following way:
- After joining it blocks the user's access to any channel, except for a newly created one to which he only has access.
- It would then start to ask the user questions.
- If the answers more or less resemble the correct answers the user will receive a new rank that allows him to join the server as a member.
- If any of them are incorrect the user will be kicked
- It checks for correct answers by checking if your answer contains some keywords of the correct answer, it would not be cap sensitive.
